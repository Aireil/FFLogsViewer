# FFLogsViewer
Small plugin to view FFLogs ranking percentiles in-game using Dalamud provided by [XIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher).

To install, see instructions on [my repo](https://github.com/Aireil/MyDalamudPlugins) (global client).\
[兼容国服](https://github.com/Nukoooo/FFLogsViewer)的版本在这里 (Chinese client).

For commands, look in the installer.

To get percentiles in the plugin window, you will need to add an API client, step-by-step guide in settings.  
No API client needed to use the context menu item when opening in a browser.

## Context Menu
Adds a context menu item nearly everywhere you have a name.  
Setting in config to open the character page in your default browser instead of the plugin window.
