# FFLogsViewer

Small plugin to view FFLogs ranking percentiles in-game using Dalamud provided by [XIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher).

To install, add `https://github.com/Aireil/MyDalamudPlugins/raw/master/pluginmaster.json` under "Custom Plugin Repositories" in the "Experimental" tab of Dalamud's in game settings, and then install it through the plugin installer.

/fflogs to open the plugin window.  
/fflogsconfig to open the plugin config.

To get percentiles in the plugin window, you will need to add an API client, step-by-step guide in /fflogsconfig.  
No API client needed to use the context menu item when opening in a browser.

## Context menu

Adds a context menu item nearly everywhere you have a name.  
Setting in config to open the character page in your default browser instead of the plugin window.
